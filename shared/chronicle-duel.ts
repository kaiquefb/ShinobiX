 * that passed an absent player's turns forever: the player who stayed had to sit
 * through a full minute per absent turn, and a walk-out never counted as a loss.
 *
 *   1. An expired Snare response window is passed, as before. That is the clock
 *      acting for the responder, so it neither strikes nor clears them.
 *   2. An expired TURN strikes the active duelist only if they did nothing all
 *      turn. Acting clears their streak, so a player who is present but slow is
 *      never punished; their turn is passed exactly as before.
 *   3. The CHRONICLE_AFK_STRIKE_LIMIT-th missed turn in a row forfeits the duel
 *      through the engine's own forfeit action, so every host settles it exactly
 *      like a manual forfeit (war damage, contest swing, no Free Play credit).
