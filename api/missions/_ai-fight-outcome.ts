 * Step 4 — the outcome of a sealed AI fight, read from the SESSION.
 *
 * Before this, `report-ai-fight` paid on the client's say-so: calling the
 * endpoint at all WAS the claim that the player had won. The reward amounts were
 * already sealed (the token carries baseXp/baseRyo), so the exposure was not the
 * size of the payout — it was that a client could claim a win it never earned,
 * and that losing cost nothing because no defeat was ever reported.
 *
 * Both halves close here. The session is server-owned and server-resolved, so it
 * is the authority on BOTH questions: did the player win, and what HP did they
 * walk away with.
 *
 * This matters as much for difficulty as for anti-cheat. Sealed settlement must
 * persist surviving HP and hospitalize a knocked-out player, so failed hunts or
 * raids cannot become free retries.
