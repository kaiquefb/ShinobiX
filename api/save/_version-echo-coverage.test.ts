/*
 * Any endpoint that bumps a player's stored save version should TELL that player.
 *
 * The client echoes its last known version as `_baseSaveVersion` on every autosave, and
 * the save route rejects a stale one with 409. The client's 409 recovery refetches the
 * server snapshot and applies it wholesale — so a version the client never learned about
 * turns its next autosave into a silent rollback of whatever it had in flight.
 *
 * The client side needs nothing per endpoint: authFetch's observeSaveVersion picks
 * `_saveVersion` out of ANY JSON response body and adopts it monotonically
 * (SAVE_VERSION_EVENT → App.tsx). So "tell the player" just means including
 * `_saveVersion` in the response.
 *
 * This is a RATCHET, not a clean bill of health. `ECHOES_VERSION` is fixed and must stay
 * fixed. `PENDING_ECHO` is the known-unfixed backlog: when you fix one, move it up —
 * the test fails if a pending file starts echoing, which keeps the list honest and
 * shrinking. Anything not in either list, and not exempt, fails the build so a NEW
 * save-mutating endpoint forces a deliberate decision.
