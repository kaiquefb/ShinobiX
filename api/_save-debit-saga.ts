/*
 * Retry-safe "player save -> shared record" economy settlement (issue #179).
 *
 * The mirror image of api/_cross-key-settlement.ts. There a shared record is
 * debited and a player save credited; here a player's save is DEBITED and one
 * shared record is CREDITED: a shrine ledger, the bounty board, a clan row, a
 * village row. The two writes cannot be one transaction, so each lands with its
 * own durable receipt in the SAME write as the value it moves:
 *
 *   1. The debit and an in-save `serverSettlementReceipts` entry are one save
 *      write (the api/bank/transfer.ts convention). The same request id can
 *      never debit twice.
 *   2. The credit and a `settlementReceipts` entry on the shared record are one
 *      write. The same request id can never credit twice.
 *   3. The economy-tx journal (`economy-tx:<id>`, listed as "stuck" by
 *      /api/admin/economy until it finishes) records progress and the result a
 *      replay returns, and outlives the capped in-save receipt list.
 *
 * Lock order is the shared record first, then the player save — the order
 * every one of these endpoints already used, so nothing can deadlock.
 *
 * Recovery:
 *   - A retry of a request that fully settled returns its stored result and
 *     moves nothing.
 *   - A retry of a request whose debit landed but whose credit did not (the
 *     process stopped between the writes, or the credit write failed and its
 *     compensation failed too) rolls the credit FORWARD, exactly once.
 *   - A definition may supply `refund`: when the credit write of a fresh
 *     request fails, the debit and its receipt are reversed in one save write,
 *     so the player is not left charged for something that never happened.
 *     Currency-only sinks (shrine, bounty placement) do; donations, whose
 *     debit also moves items, merit and daily counters, roll forward instead.
 *   - Admin reconciliation calls resumeSaveDebitSaga with the journal id, and
 *     it runs the same credit step.
 *
 * The one thing a receipt list cannot prove is a NEGATIVE once the list has
 * evicted entries (both lists are capped). A roll-forward therefore credits
 * only when the missing receipt is provably missing; otherwise the journal is
 * flagged `needs-reconcile` and nothing is credited twice.
