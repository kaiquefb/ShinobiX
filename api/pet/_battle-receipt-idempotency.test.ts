/*
 * Exactly-once for the pet-arena ryo faucet.
 *
 * Both paid pet modes — the legacy coliseum (pet/battle-result.ts) and Showdown
 * (pet/showdown.ts) — dedupe payouts against the SAME character array,
 * redeemedPetBattleTokens. An array is a rolling window: it is truncated before
 * every append, so a busy player evicts their own older receipts. A receipt that
 * gets evicted while the thing it de-duplicates is still redeemable is not a
 * receipt at all — the same fight can be cashed again.
 *
 * The guard is a pair. The array is written in the same save write as the ryo,
 * so it is exact but short-lived. The durable `pet:battle-paid:` key is not
 * touched by other battles, so it outlives the eviction; its TTL is what must
 * cover the redeemable window (a 45-minute Showdown session, a 15-minute battle
 * token). Behaviour below, source shape after it — the ordering guarantees
 * (check before paying, place after paying, lease stamped only on the finishing
 * turn) are not visible to a behavioural test without standing up the whole
 * endpoint, and they are exactly what a careless refactor drops.
