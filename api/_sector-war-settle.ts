/*
 * Sector-war SETTLEMENT — the IO half of the 72-hour scored war.
 *
 * The pure verdict lives in api/_sector-war.ts settleSectorWar: when the window
 * closes, attacker strictly ahead → the sector flips; defender ahead or tied →
 * the defence held. This module applies that verdict durably:
 *
 *   · flip  → captureSectorForVillage (the world:territory owner change the WR
 *             faucet and tax tier key off) + sector.capture telemetry. The
 *             settled record is an inert audit row that ages out with its
 *             own battle receipts (SECTOR_CAPTURED_RECORD_TTL_SEC); it used
 *             to be written with no ttl at all and never left the keyspace.
 *   · hold  → the record is stamped 'defended' and saved WITH the re-siege
 *             cooldown TTL, so the lingering record IS the attacker's cooldown.
 *
 * Called LAZILY from the endpoint's hot paths (the war-map status poll, declare)
 * so a finished war settles within seconds of a player looking at it, and from
 * the daily village-war pass as the backstop for wars nobody is watching. Both
 * paths converge on the same per-war lock, so double-settlement is impossible.
 *
 * Lives in its own module because of an import cycle: world-state.ts imports the
 * sector-war STORE (activeSectorWarsForVillage, for the village-war mutual
 * exclusion), so the store cannot import captureSectorForVillage back. This file
 * sits above both. Underscore-prefixed → a helper, not a route.
