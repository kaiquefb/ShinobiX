/*
 * The village treasury transfer (api/_cross-key-settlement.ts) treats a
 * `settlementReceipts` entry on the village row as proof that the treasury was
 * ALREADY debited for that transaction, and on that proof skips the treasury
 * balance check, the recipient checks (membership, shared connection, the
 * Kage's 24h send budget) and the debit itself, then credits the recipient.
 *
 * That proof is only sound if nothing but the server can write it. The clan
 * save validator pins the field as server-owned; the village-state blob write
 * (POST /api/game-state kind 'villageState') merged `{ ...prev, ...incoming }`
 * without pinning it. So a seated Kage could plant a matching receipt through
 * an ordinary village-state save and then gift ryo the treasury does not hold:
 * minted currency, repeatable once per request id.
