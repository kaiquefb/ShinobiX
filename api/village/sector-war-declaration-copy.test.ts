 * /api/village/sector-war — declaration-fault copy.
 *
 * The six 503s in doDeclare all mean "the war chest's bookkeeping for this
 * sector could not be trusted, so nothing was charged". They used to hand the
 * Kage the DIAGNOSTIC as the message ("Sector-war funding fingerprint is
 * invalid; an administrator must inspect it."). Now each one returns a single
 * player-facing sentence and the technical detail is logged server-side.
 *
 * Source-text contract: reproducing a torn funding row through the handler needs
 * a corrupted KV fixture per branch, which pins implementation rather than copy.
