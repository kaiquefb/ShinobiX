/*
 * URL hash + browser history for the app shell.
 *
 * Owns two related things that both write window.history, kept together so they
 * cannot fight each other:
 *
 *  1. The shareable URL hash (`#/village`) — BOTH surfaces, unchanged behaviour,
 *     moved verbatim out of App.tsx.
 *  2. The Android hardware back button — PLAY APP ONLY.
 *
 * WHY BACK IS APP-ONLY. In an installed app, back means "up one screen" and
 * Android users expect it; on a website, back is the browser's own affordance
 * and intercepting it is the classic back-button trap. So on the web this module
 * pushes no history entries and installs no popstate listener — byte-for-byte
 * the behaviour that shipped before it existed.
 *
 * ⛔ THE LANDMINE. App.tsx used replaceState deliberately: "no new history
 * entries and no popstate — so it never conflicts with the localStorage restore
 * or the mobile back-stack". Directly above it, lastScreen.v1 exists because
 * routing a refresh to the village "was the bug that let players refresh-flee a
 * fight". A back stack re-opens exactly that hole: back out of a fight, refresh,
 * and the restore would honour the screen you backed into. So back is REFUSED
 * while a battle is unresolved — the entry is pushed straight back and the
 * player stays put, with Forfeit remaining the only exit. Back must never become
 * a flee route.
 *
 * Back is also refused toward any screen that is not deep-linkable, reusing
 * screen-guards' own definition of "renders correctly from the loaded save
 * alone". Landing on a stale battle screen with no sealed session is the other
 * half of the same failure.
