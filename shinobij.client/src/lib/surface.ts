/*
 * Which surface is this document running on — the Play Store app, or the web?
 *
 * Used ONLY to vary UI affordances that genuinely differ by platform (the
 * Android hardware back button, an install promo, later the storefront button).
 * Every screen, feature and API call is identical on both; there is one build
 * and no fork.
 *
 * ⛔ NEVER an authority. The value is derived on the client and is therefore
 * forgeable. The Flutter shell's User-Agent token (below) is set by the client
 * too, so the server must not read it either. Entitlements stay server-verified
 * exactly as they are today (see api/_subscription.ts): a Play purchase is
 * trusted because its token validates against Google's API, never because a
 * client claimed to be the app.
 *
 * DETECTION, in order of reliability:
 *  1. The User-Agent carries APP_SHELL_UA_TOKEN — the Flutter WebView shell
 *     (mobile/) appends it before its first load, so it is present on every
 *     document, reloads included, before any script runs.
 *  2. `document.referrer` starts with `android-app://<package>` — Chrome's
 *     canonical TWA signal, set on the LAUNCH navigation. It does not survive a
 *     reload (including the boot-watchdog's "Reload latest game"), so the first
 *     answer is persisted for the tab and reused. Kept for installs of the older
 *     TWA shell.
 *  3. Play Billing availability is a separate CAPABILITY check, not this flag —
 *     see canUsePlayBilling(). Gate purchase UI on that, because if it is absent
 *     the purchase cannot work regardless of what surface we think we are on.
 *
 * ⛔ NOT used: `display-mode: standalone`. It is true in a TWA *and* true for a
 * PWA installed from mobile Chrome via Add to Home Screen. Since the site now
 * ships a manifest, Add-to-Home-Screen users are real, and gating app-only UI on
 * standalone would hand them a back button (or later a purchase button) that
 * cannot work. Installed-ness and app-ness are different questions.
