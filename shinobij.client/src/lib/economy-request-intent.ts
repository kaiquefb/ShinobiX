/*
 * One retry identity per logical economy action (issue #179).
 *
 * The shrine offering, bounty placement, clan / village treasury donation,
 * clan Honor Seal pool, Hollow Gate unlock, Kage challenge and clan war
 * declaration endpoints settle each `requestId` exactly once
 * (api/_save-debit-saga.ts, api/_cross-key-settlement.ts):
 * sending the same id again returns the first result instead of charging
 * again, and finishes a charge whose second half never landed. That only helps
 * if a retry of the same action carries the same id, so the id is kept — in
 * memory and in sessionStorage, which survives a reload of the tab — until the
 * server gives an answer that cannot change on a retry. The pattern is the
 * Bank screen's (bank-transfer-intent.ts), generalized over the action.
 *
 * While an id is pending the screen must not refuse the action locally: after
 * a reload the balance may already show the charge whose credit the retry is
 * about to finish.
