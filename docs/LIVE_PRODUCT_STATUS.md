# ShinobiX Live Product Status

Current authority as of September 14, 2026
Repository verification base: `957e3ae2056ffa443b5975d067bcd91646dca59f` (tagged `v0.2.0-beta`)

This file is the canonical repository authority for current product stage and player-facing availability. Dated launch recommendations, rollout matrices, release notes, and implementation reports are historical evidence; when their availability wording conflicts with this file or executable runtime behavior, this file and the runtime win.

## Current product stage

ShinobiX is a live public-beta browser MMORPG. The public game is named **Shinobi Journey**; the repository and backend remain **ShinobiX**. This is not a claim of a 1.0 release or of credentialed production health at every moment.

The active architecture is React 19 and Vite on the client, an Express/TypeScript server on Railway, Supabase/Postgres storage, and Socket.IO realtime.

## Shipped player systems

The shipped game includes:

- Academy onboarding, training, jutsu, missions, hunts, inventory, shops, banking, hospital, cafeteria, world travel, and ordinary shinobi PvE/PvP.
- First Contract, the optional illustrated field journal that follows the Academy.
- Ranked PvP, Battle Towers, Endless Spire, Weekly Boss, Hollow Gate, story, and village chronicles.
- The Celestial Tower campaigns: Echoes of War, which is played on the Chronicle Showdown card engine and pays Chronicle Points, and The First Pact, a level-100 companion campaign.
- Companions, Pet Arena, Pet Coliseum, Pet Ladder, Beastbound Warfront, Pet Gauntlet, expeditions, and breeding. The ranked Pet Ladder resolves on Beastbound Warfront.
- Shinobi Chronicle Showdown/Card Clash, including its AI, free-play, clan-war, and sector-war uses.
- Clans, Clan Boss Operations, Village War, Sector War, professions, Legacy, and Hall of Legends.
- Village leadership with the Kage and elected Elders, and the admin-scheduled Dojo Circuit event between the four villages.
- An in-world day and night of two real hours, with weather that changes in steps.
- The Premium Shop, where Fate Shards and the Shinobi Supporter subscription are sold through a Tebex web checkout. The village Shop is ryo-only, and the Android app never shows a web checkout.
- Bloodlines, including the Bloodline Forge and the server-authoritative awakening flow.
- Companion idle growth progression, with allocation recomputed from immutable species stats on the server.
- The in-game player guide library.

These systems are launched. Operational monitoring and emergency switches do not make them prelaunch features. Their level, ownership, clan, subscription, event, and other gameplay eligibility rules still apply.

Ordinary shinobi combat, the N-actor Tower engine, and Chronicle combat are
intentionally separate. Companion combat is itself split across turn-based
Showdown, positional Warfront/Tactical, Gauntlet grid, cinematic Arena, retained
legacy compatibility, and client-local presentation authorities; their current
routes and defects are projected from the executable runtime registry rather
than collapsed into one generic pet engine.

## Progression truth

- The only level-progression exam holds are Genin at level 20 and Chunin at level 39.
- Jonin rank begins through normal level progression at level 50. Its Logbook ceremony is optional prestige.
- Special Jonin rank begins through normal level progression at level 80. The existing 100-PvP-kill plus Kage/Elder ceremony is optional prestige and does not block leveling, stats, jutsu, content, or character power.
- Persistent exam keys and server-verified ceremony requirements remain unchanged.

## Runtime defaults and required configuration

Repository defaults describe what the checked-in server does; they do not prove the value of a deployed environment.

| Capability | Repository behavior | Deployment requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Village War and Sector War | Enabled at server startup unless its emergency disable switch is active. | No opt-in flag is required. `DISABLE_VILLAGE_WAR=1` stops the sector war, its map, mercenaries, the daily war pass and the village tax. It does not stop war missions, war crates or the all-out village war (which then costs Honor Seals instead of War Resources). |
| Clan Boss and Operations | Enabled at server startup unless its system or party emergency disable switch is active. | No opt-in flag is required. |
| New pet-breeding starts | Available unless its emergency start switch is active; existing eggs and timers continue. | No opt-in flag is required. |
| Weekly Boss guard cycle | Available unless its emergency mechanic switch is active. | The core Weekly Boss remains a shipped system. |
| Legacy and Hall of Legends | Routes require the Legacy deployment setting to be enabled. | Production/staging must provide that setting for this shipped system. A missing value is a configuration incident, not a rollout state. |
| Public AI image generation | Off unless intentionally enabled. | Remains permission-, moderation-, and budget-controlled; admin tools are not ordinary-player access. |

The public `/api/player/capabilities` projection reports only bounded availability states and reason codes. It does not return environment-variable names, values, secrets, tokens, diagnostics, player data, or configuration contents.

## Live-operations controls

The following are emergency safeguards, not launch labels:

- Maintenance mode pauses Express player API traffic while operator recovery remains available; it does not stop scheduled, realtime, or other in-process writers.
- The gameplay-mutation capability pauses admission of new unsafe-method player HTTP requests. GET-triggered settlement, scheduled jobs, realtime sessions, and storage writers require separate controls.
- Registration can be paused independently.
- Village War, Clan Boss, Clan Boss parties, new pet-breeding starts, and the Weekly Boss guard cycle have scoped disable controls.
- Scheduled jobs can be paused independently.

Admin authentication, content/economy moderation, image generation, dangerous recovery actions, and creator administration remain permission-based. No public status document broadens those boundaries.

## Certification evidence

Automated repository verification:

```text
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm run sizecheck
npm run certify:release
npm run check:deployment
npm run check:rollback-readiness
npm run test:backup
npm run test:mission-eligibility
npm run test:release-assets
npm run check:tooling-handoffs
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
cd shinobij.client
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
# CI's browser gate requires an instrumented public-dummy build. Without this
# opt-in DSN, reporting is correctly disabled and that one smoke assertion is skipped.
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://public@example.invalid/1 VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE=qa VITE_BUILD_COMMIT=local-qa npm run build
CI=1 npm run test:e2e
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

These commands cover type/build integrity, unit and integration behavior, route and deployment packaging, release certification, rollback assets, backup tooling, mission eligibility, asset integrity, browser flows, size, and dependency audits. A clean repository run does not replace credentialed checks against a deployed service.

Checks requiring a safe target and credentials include fresh-account/live-save smoke, real multiplayer concurrency, authenticated admin tools, production storage/backup observations, and environment-specific Legacy availability. No current credentialed production result was established while authoring this authority; consult retained live evidence before making an incident or availability claim.

## Releases

Tagged snapshots and their notes are published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Timehue/ShinobiX/releases). The current one is [`v0.2.0-beta`](https://github.com/Timehue/ShinobiX/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta), tagged September 14, 2026, and it is this file's verification base. Release notes are dated evidence like the documents below; where they disagree with this file, this file wins.

## Historical evidence

- [`PUBLIC_BETA_LAUNCH_RECOMMENDATION.md`](../PUBLIC_BETA_LAUNCH_RECOMMENDATION.md) — July 7 prelaunch recommendation.
- [`FEATURE_FLAG_RELEASE_MATRIX.md`](../FEATURE_FLAG_RELEASE_MATRIX.md) — rollout-era matrix and closeout evidence.
- [`docs/BETA_LIVE_OPERATIONS.md`](BETA_LIVE_OPERATIONS.md) — earlier launch configuration guidance; incident procedures remain useful.
- [`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.0-beta.md`](RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.0-beta.md) — draft first-beta notes.
- [`docs/MMO_ROUNDNESS_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`](MMO_ROUNDNESS_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md) — implementation and certification evidence for Clan Boss Operations and Activity Spine.

Preserve these documents. Their dated recommendations do not override current launched-system truth.
