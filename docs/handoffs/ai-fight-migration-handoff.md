## ⚠ Read this before trusting ANY handoff, including this one

This file cost a later session a full rebuild of work that was already live.
It said, in bold, that "the only unfinished thing is the Endless client half" —
and `origin/main` still pointed at this document's own commit (`74e2177e6`), so
it read as current. Main was **71 commits ahead on another branch** and the
feature had shipped. That session rebuilt it from scratch, gates and all, before
noticing.

**A handoff SHA matching `origin/main` proves the DOCUMENT is unchanged. It
proves nothing about the WORK.** Run `git fetch origin main && git log --oneline
<handoff-sha>..origin/main` and read it before acting on any "next step".

## Where things actually landed

The authority boundary now (from `SERVER_COMBAT_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`):

| Runtime | Owns |
|---|---|
| `api/solo-pve/*` | every one-human/one-AI shinobi fight: catalog + published AI, hunts, ambushes, guards, wanderers, all built-in combat missions, **Academy sparring**, story battles, normal **Endless**, Hollow Gate shinobi combat, **Weekly Boss**, **ANBU** |
| `api/towers/*` | genuine party / N-actor encounters only: Battle Towers, Endless **Spire**, Clan Boss |
| `api/pvp/*` | player-versus-player |
| Pet / Card | independent runtimes |

Mode bindings seal owner, mode identity, derived enemy, reward fingerprint, Solo
session id, expiry and settlement state — so each mode's economy stays separate
from the combat runtime, and Solo / Tower / PvP / Pet evidence cannot
cross-settle.

The pieces this handoff's own pass contributed all survive inside that runtime,
adapted rather than replaced: `api/story/_academy-spar.ts` (constants,
eligibility, binding), `validateSealedStoryRun`, the Endless wave modules
(`_wave-opponent.ts`, `_wave-session.ts`, `wave-start.ts`), and the
`isCatalogFloorRun` guard in `api/towers/_tower-store.ts`.

⚠ **Endless shipped on a DIFFERENT design than the "next steps" below sketch.**
No launch bus, no host component. `use-endless-tower-actions` holds an
`EndlessServerFight` and calls `startEndlessWave`; a lazily-loaded
`screens/EndlessTowerFight.tsx` renders it; the settle is `action:'settle'`,
which reports a **loss** as well as a win; and the local Arena fallback was
removed outright. Regen-versus-attrition is handled in `screen-guards.ts` via
`case "endlessTower": return s.endlessBattleActive`.

⚠ **The local fallbacks are gone, by design.** `applyAcademySparSettlement` now
requires the sealed opponent id exactly and no longer accepts
`temp-academy-spar-*`; per the plan, "no rewarding path falls back to a locally
resolved shinobi fight". The `playLocally` degrade described further down no
longer exists — do not reintroduce it expecting the old contract.

### Three traps this pass, worth reading before you touch anything

1. **A red CI is not automatically your diff.** `632b6da19` was server-only and
   went red at the **Client audit** step: a new advisory
   (`brace-expansion` GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895) was published against a tree that had
   not moved, and `npm audit --audit-level=high` started failing. Dev dependency
   (`eslint → minimatch`), nothing shipped. Fix was
   `npm audit fix --package-lock-only` in `shinobij.client/`, lockfile only.
   **Check whether the SAME step passed on the previous commit before you go
   hunting in your own changes.** A red main also blocks the Railway deploy, so
   whatever is queued behind it is not live — here that was a security guard.
2. **A green guard means nothing until you make it fail.** One of this pass's
   source guards had a literal **backspace byte** where `\b` was meant (a
   scripted edit wrote `"\b"` through a non-raw string), so its regex matched
   nothing and it passed vacuously. Mutation-verify every guard you add.
   Related: the certify fight loop first timed out with the run still `active`,
   because a refused move still returns a session — read `applied`, not the
   session's presence.
3. **The `Monitor` tool went silent twice** on GitHub-run watches that did
   complete. `Bash` with `run_in_background` and an `until` loop that exits on
   the terminal state reported reliably every time. Prefer that.

## Older context: steps 1–4

Steps 1–4 are ALL on main, plus four real bug fixes found by auditing them (see
"Bugs this pass fixed").

⚠ **Read this before your next main push — it cost a red main for ~6 hours.**
The first push (`478475433`) went red on the **Root build** step. Not the game
code: every test, typecheck and certify passed. It was the **sizecheck**, and the
cause is the documented local-vs-CI divergence. CI sets `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, so
`@sentry/vite-plugin` injects instrumentation into the product chunks; a bare
local `npm run build` under-reports. Local said `all emitted: 6.80 MB` and PASS,
CI said **6.88 MB** and failed — the ceiling was missed by **179 bytes**.

**So do not gate on a bare `npm run build`. Reproduce CI's bundle:**

```bash
export VITE_SENTRY_DSN="https://public@example.invalid/1" \
       VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE=ci VITE_BUILD_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
npm run build        # from the REPO ROOT — sizecheck now prints CI's numbers
```

That DSN is the public-format dummy `.github/workflows/ci.yml` itself uses, so it
sends nothing. For exact bytes rather than the rounded log line, sum `dist`
`.js`+`.css` minus `assets/sentry-vendor-*.js` — that IS what CI computes.

`TOTAL_JS_CSS_FAIL_BYTES` moved 7.135 → 7.150 MB, paid for partly by deleting
dead code (`lib/ai-fight-flag.ts` returned a hardcoded `true`; its three Arena
branches were unreachable). **The startup gates were NOT relaxed** — entry JS,
initial graph raw + gzip, per-chunk and CSS are unchanged and green. The ceiling
is permanently tight: budget a drain into the next feature, not a bump.

⚠ A red Root build means **Client lint, Client build, the Playwright smoke and
Client audit never ran** — a red build tells you nothing about those four.

Gates on the green tree, all exit 0: `npm test` **4690/4690**,
`tsc -p tsconfig.cpanel.json`, client `tsc`, `npm run build` **with CI's Sentry
env** (sizecheck PASS, all emitted 6.88 MB = CI's own figure),
`npm run certify:release` **28/28**, client `npm run lint` 0 errors.

### Bugs this pass fixed (all were LIVE)

| Bug | Effect before |
|---|---|
| Weekly boss had no boss→player clamp or guard cycle | boss dealt its raw sheet — ~9k on a 10k-HP fighter, a near-one-shot |
| Apex kill receipt never written | the Apex purse could **never** be claimed |
| No server PvE mode charged for a defeat | losing a mission / story boss / AI fight cost nothing; instant full-HP retry |
| An unverifiable settle resolved quietly | one dropped request on a win = reward silently lost, token unspent |

⚠ **Earlier pushes CHANGED LIVE PvE BALANCE.** Steps B and C (already on main
before this pass) are not inert. Combat missions, story bosses, tower/Spire
floors and the clan boss run the standard-PvE hit guard, and their AI enemies
cast at real jutsu mastery instead of 30%. Both ship ON, with rollback switches
below. B and C were deliberately pushed TOGETHER — B alone softens PvE, C alone
spikes it; they are the equilibrium only as a pair.

**Rollback, in order of bluntness:**

| Switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DISABLE_PVE_AI_MASTERY=1` | enemies return to 30% jutsu damage (undo C) |
| `DISABLE_PVE_DIFFICULTY_GUARD=1` | removes the band + hit guard (undo B) |
| `DISABLE_PVE_AI_MASTERY_<MODE>` | one mode only: `MISSION` `STORY` `TOWER` `SPIRE` `CLAN_BOSS` |
| `DISABLE_PVE_DIFFICULTY_GUARD_<MODE>` | one mode only: `MISSION` `STORY` `AI_FIGHT` `TOWER` `CLAN_BOSS` |

`SPIRE` is the dial most likely to be wanted: its level-100 bosses sit in the
PEER band where the hit guard is an intentional no-op, so the ~3.3x mastery
uplift is **unbounded** there — the largest single difficulty swing in the push.

**3d is now COMPLETE (client + server) and the AI-fight path ships ON.** The flag
inverted: `serverAiCombatEnabled()` reads `DISABLE_SERVER_AI_COMBAT !== '1'`, so
an empty env arms it and only the explicit kill switch takes it out (pinned by a
test, so "ships on" cannot silently regress). Turning it off makes the endpoint
seal nothing, and every routed launch site degrades to the local Arena through
its own `playLocally` fallback.

| Switch | Effect |
|---|---|
| `DISABLE_SERVER_AI_COMBAT=1` | no encounter is sealed; every AI fight plays on the local Arena |
| `DISABLE_WEEKLY_BOSS_GUARD=1` | undo the weekly-boss clamp AND its guard cycle (matched pair) |

**There is no kill switch for the defeat cost** (`/api/pve/fight-outcome`), and
that is deliberate: it restores behaviour the local Arena always had. Losing a
fight is supposed to cost something. If it ever needs backing out, stop passing
`outcomeFn` at the call sites rather than adding a flag.

## Done

| Step | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `aiOpponentEnemyTemplate` — defeatable enemy from an AI profile | `api/_authoritative-pve.ts` |
| 2 | `ai-fight-start` seals a real encounter, returns `runId` | `api/missions/ai-fight-start.ts`, `_ai-fight-encounter.ts` |
| 2 | Generated mirror of the 71 built-in AI profiles | `api/_ai-profile-catalog.ts` |
| 2 | AI loadout resolution (catalog ∪ admin, sanitized) | `api/_ai-opponent-loadout.ts` |
| 3a | Server port of the AI level curves + `relevelBuiltinAi` | `api/_ai-level-curves.ts` |
| 3b | Server port of the PvE difficulty layer | `api/_pve-difficulty.ts` |
| 3b | `damageCap` threaded through the damage resolver; guard wired | `api/combat-core/resolveJutsu.ts`, `api/pvp/move.ts`, `api/towers/_engine.ts` |
| A | The four band-behaviour helpers wired into the engine's action picker | `api/towers/_engine.ts`, `api/_pve-ai-tactics.ts` |
| B | The band + hit guard armed on every other server PvE mode | `api/_pve-band-seal.ts` |
| C | Server AI enemies given their real jutsu mastery | `api/_pve-ai-mastery.ts` |
| 3c | Encounter scaling derived from SERVER state | `api/missions/_ai-fight-scaling.ts` |
| 3d | `ai-fight-start` returns the sealed session (server half only) | `api/missions/ai-fight-start.ts` |

Parity/behaviour tests: `scripts/ai-profile-catalog.test.mjs`,
`scripts/ai-level-curve-parity.test.ts` (~38.6k comparisons),
`scripts/pve-difficulty-parity.test.ts` (>5k-case guard grid),
`api/towers/_pve-guard.test.ts`, `api/missions/_ai-fight-encounter.test.ts`.
The three parity suites were **mutation-verified** (a deliberate wrong constant
fails them) rather than trusted for being green.

## ⚠ The finding that matters most: server AI casts at 30% damage

`api/pvp/move.ts` `applyJutsu` reads jutsu mastery off the **caster's**
`character.jutsuMastery`. **No server enemy template has ever carried one**, so
every server-sealed AI casts at `masteryDamageFrac(0) = 0.3` — 30% of the jutsu
damage the client's PvE AI deals (the client passes `pveAiMasteryForLevel`
explicitly). Corroboration that this is an oversight, not a balance choice:
`api/towers/_merc-fighters.ts:66` gives squad-side AI **allies** `level: 50`.

Empirically confirmed at ~3.3× in `api/towers/_pve-guard.test.ts`.

**Fixed for AI fights only.** Still open for **combat missions, story bosses,
Hollow Gate, the towers, clan boss, Anbu vault and the weekly boss** — their
templates were hand-tuned with mastery 0 in place, so correcting them is a real
balance change. Very likely why some server PvE reads as limp.

## Owner rulings (2026-08-02)

1. **Guard first, then mastery everywhere.** Do not enable enemy mastery in the
   other modes until the difficulty guard is extended to them — those modes have
   no mercy caps today, so tripling enemy jutsu damage first would wreck
   onboarding (the E-rank drill especially).
2. **Extend the guard + band layer to every server PvE mode, default ON with a
   kill switch.**
3. Arena practice spar keeps its player-chosen level slider; the server seals
   whatever level was chosen. Reward is flat and daily-capped, so the exposure
   is bounded throughput — no worse than today's fake-a-win.
4. Scope is: finish the AI-fight migration.

## ~~Next, in order~~ — ALL DONE (historical)

⛔ Every item below shipped, and the ones that were still open when this was
written were finished by the `codex/solo-pve-cutover` workstream. Nothing here is
a task. See "Where things actually landed" at the top.

### ~~A. Wire the four AI-behaviour helpers~~ — DONE

All four now drive `bestAffordableJutsu` / `pickAiAction`, gated on a sealed
`session.pveGuard` **and** `side === 'enemy'` (so squad-side AI — async allies,
AFK humans — and every mode that seals no guard stay byte-identical):

- **burst hold** — `pveEasyBandHoldsBurst` + `pveIsBurstJutsuAp` filter 60+ AP
  jutsu out of the pool for rounds 1-2 in the easy band. `session.round` is the
  right mirror of the client's `turn` (both advance once per full round).
- **lethal intent** — `pveEasyBandAllowsLethal` makes the AI *prefer* the
  strongest non-lethal option against a player above 25% HP. It only
  DEPRIORITIZES, like the client: with no weaker option it still casts, so the
  AI is never disarmed into passivity.
- **competence** — `pveAiCompetence` emits `clear` / `cleanse` actions at the
  band thresholds, ahead of the jutsu pick (the client's order).

Two of `PveAiCompetence`'s five fields have no server analogue and are
deliberately **not** wired — see the header of `api/_pve-ai-tactics.ts`:
`usesSmartScorer` (the engine has one policy, not two) and `readsBehavior`.
`readsBehavior` needs no port because it is **inert on the client too**: it is
applied as `readsBehavior && justPoweredUp ? 1 : clearBuffThreshold`, and it is
true only in the hard and peer bands, which already carry `clearBuffThreshold:
1`. That ternary can never change the threshold, so no server-side action memory
is needed to match client behaviour. It also means the server never needs the
profile's `masterAi` flag (the sole input `usesSmartScorer` depends on) — which
is just as well, since `aiOpponentEnemyTemplate` does not carry it through.

⚠ Two traps this turned up:

- **Folding the PvE hit cap into the lethal estimate makes the gate dead code.**
  The easy-band per-hit cap is 20% of max HP while the gate only engages above
  25%, so a capped estimate can never reach the KO threshold. The estimate is
  the RAW hit, mirroring the client (which scans raw and clamps separately at
  resolution).
- **The burst hold changes turn 1 of every easy-band AI fight** — the foe now
  approaches instead of opening with a nuke. This broke the *correctly written*
  non-vacuity assertion in `_pve-guard.test.ts` ("the enemy must land damage"),
  which was updated to advance until the enemy actually swings.

New tests: `api/towers/_pve-band-ai.test.ts` (14 cases, incl. the two no-op
guarantees) and `scripts/pve-ai-tactics-parity.test.ts`. Both mutation-verified —
disabling the hold, inverting the lethal gate, shifting the Clear threshold,
letting the band reach squad actors, and drifting the buff list each fail them.

### ~~B. Extend the guard + band to the other PvE modes~~ — DONE

`api/_pve-band-seal.ts` is the single place every entry point calls.
**Shipped ON**; `DISABLE_PVE_DIFFICULTY_GUARD=1` is a rollback, and each mode
also has `DISABLE_PVE_DIFFICULTY_GUARD_<MODE>`. A test asserts an empty env arms
every mode, so "ships on" cannot silently regress.

| Mode | Guard | Band | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| missions, story | ✅ | ✅ | canonical standard PvE — solo, level-keyed, AI template |
| towers / Spire, clan boss | ✅ | ❌ | already floor- + party- + ascension-scaled; clan boss HP is the SHARED pool |
| AI fights | ✅ | ✅ | unchanged maths, now answers the kill switch |
| weekly boss, Anbu | ❌ | ❌ | see below |

⚠ **Towers and clan boss call `startRound`/`runAiUntilHuman` inline at start** —
the seal must precede them or the opening enemy turn resolves unguarded. Pinned
by a test.

⚠ **The seal is idempotent on two levels** (session `pveGuard`, per-actor
`pveBandScaled`). Compounding 0.6 × 0.6 would trivialize a tuned fight; the
per-actor stamp is what protects a scale-only call, which leaves no guard behind.

**Correction to the previous handoff.** It warned that arming the weekly boss
would "double-clamp" its own guard cycle. The real reason to leave it out is
sharper: `weeklyBossGuardedHit` is **8% per hit / 15% per turn, no band, no
mercy** — roughly **5× TIGHTER** than the hard band this layer would install
(45%/70%). Arming the standard guard there applies the *wrong* mechanic, not a
safer one. And it was never ported, so **the server weekly boss has NO
boss→player clamp today while the client has one** — a real gap, worth its own
commit. (The per-hit cap in `_weekly-boss-fight-token.ts` is the OPPOSITE
direction: anti-cheat validation of client-reported PLAYER→boss damage.)

**Anbu** is excluded because its opponent is `getOrSealAnbuSnapshot(...)` — a
sealed snapshot of a REAL player's ANBU defender, i.e. exactly the
`opponentCharacter` case the client's `isStandardPve` carves out.

⚠ **This is a live balance change, not a parity fix.** These modes are resolved
by the SERVER engine (`MissionArenaFight` posts to `/api/towers/action`), so the
client's `isStandardPve` band never applied to them. They get **easier until C
lands**.

### ~~C. Then enemy jutsu mastery everywhere~~ — DONE

`api/_pve-ai-mastery.ts`, shipped ON with `DISABLE_PVE_AI_MASTERY=1` plus a
per-mode `DISABLE_PVE_AI_MASTERY_<MODE>`.

Armed: missions, story, tower story floors, **Spire**, clan boss — all of which
got the guard in B, which is the ordering the ruling requires. A test asserts
guard-before-mastery-before-`startRound`, so the order cannot silently invert.

Not armed: **weekly boss** (no server boss→player clamp at all — this is the
"mastery before the guard" failure; land it WITH the `weeklyBossGuardedHit`
port), **Anbu** (`sealTowerFighter` already carries the real player's own
mastery), AI fights (self-sealed at 3b), Hollow Gate (not migrated).

⚠ **Spire has its own dial.** Its level-100 bosses are PEER band, where the B
guard is an intentional no-op — so the Spire is the one armed mode where the
~3.3× uplift is **unbounded**, and the biggest single swing in the change.

⚠ The seal **never overwrites an existing `jutsuMastery` array.** That is what
makes it safe for actors sealed from a real save and idempotent on re-seal.

**Also fixed during the A/B tie-in audit:** `pveBandLevelForSession` was matching
the literal actor id `'boss'`, which only the SOLO builders use — every tower
floor was silently falling through to the max-level scan. It now reads
`phaseState.bossId` first. And a round-trip test now proves `pveGuard` survives
`writeSession`/`readSession`; every other test works in memory and would not
have caught the store dropping it.

### D. Finish the migration

- ~~**3c**~~ — **DONE** (`5286e35c5`), `api/missions/_ai-fight-scaling.ts`.

  ⚠ **Much smaller than this plan assumed, and that is a finding.**
  `relevelBuiltinAi` has exactly **ONE** call site in the entire client
  (`Arena.tsx`'s `pendingAiProfile` memo), gated on `missionBattleActive` + a
  combat-mission lookup. **Combat missions are the only entry point that
  re-levels its opponent.** Hunts, apex, rifts, endless, raid and defense all
  use the profile at its AUTHORED level — exactly what the server already
  produces when `scaling` is omitted. So `undefined` for those is the
  verified-correct answer, not a gap; it is what keeps the two sides identical.
  Do not "finish" 3c by inventing curves for them.

  `scripts/ai-fight-scaling-parity.test.ts` pins that premise: it asserts
  Arena.tsx still has exactly one `relevelBuiltinAi` call site and that it is
  still the combat-mission one. A second one → that mode silently diverges → the
  test fails instead.
- ~~**3d**~~ — **DONE, both halves.** Server: `06055d252`. Client: this commit.

  `lib/ai-fight-request.ts` (the launch bus) → `components/AiFightHost.tsx`
  (mounted once in App) → `lib/ai-fight-api.ts` (start + report) →
  `lib/ai-fight-settle.ts` (redeem + the client-owned side effects) →
  `MissionArenaFight`. `lib/ai-fight-loadout.ts` builds the host loadout.

  ⚠ **The previous plan's premise was WRONG and cost real time — read this.**
  It said "all ~8 launch sites are inside `App.tsx`". They are, but **every one
  of them builds a client-authored temporary AI** (`temp-dungeon-ai-*`,
  `temp-academy-spar-*`, `temp-vn-ai-*`, the Hollow Gate encounter, the endless
  `endless-<base>-w<wave>` clone) and stashes it in `temporaryStoryAi`. The
  server resolves `opponentId` against the catalog ∪ admin AIs, so **not one of
  those ids can ever seal** — routing them buys a start round-trip and a
  guaranteed fallback. The sealable launch sites are in **`WorldMap.tsx`,
  `Missions.tsx`, `Logbook.tsx` and `HunterBoard.tsx`**, none of which are under
  the App.tsx ratchet. App.tsx grew by only the 2-line host mount, and a drain
  (`scaleEndlessAiClone` + the pure half of `pickRandomEndlessAi` →
  `lib/endless-tower`) took the ratchet **7,754 → 7,734**.

  **Routed:** explore ambushes, village-guard raids (×4), sector raids (WorldMap
  + Logbook), the Academy exam bout, creator field missions, the **Apex**.

  **Deliberately NOT routed — each for a reason, do not "finish" these:**
  - *Every App.tsx site* + wanderers / quest bosses / story reckonings — their
    ids are built at runtime, so they can only ever fall back.
  - *E/D-rank combat missions* (`Missions.startMissionBattle`, `mission.min <= 5`)
    — their win **queues a claim** and pays nothing; routing them would pay the
    AI-fight reward AND skip the claim. Rank C+ already has its own server path
    via `combat-start`.
  - ⚠ *The tracked hunt beast* (`WorldMap.launchHuntBeastFight`) — **routing it
    silently deletes Hunt Quality.** `applyHuntOpening` is what makes tracking
    well matter: a good trail corners the beast (less HP, `hpFloorExempt`), a bad
    one enrages it (+stats). That transform is applied CLIENT-side from a
    client-held score, and the server builds from the catalog profile, so the
    beast would fight identically whether you read every sign or blundered in.
    **Blocked on the SERVER owning hunt quality** — it cannot simply be sent,
    because "cornered" makes the beast weaker and a client-chosen difficulty is
    exactly the authority this migration exists to remove. Its progress receipt
    would have to record the trail's quality. Pinned by a test.

  ⚠ **Reward authority was already server-side, which is why 3d before 4 is
  safe.** The token carries `baseXp`/`baseRyo` (`rewardSource: 'server-save'`),
  so `validateAiFightRewardClaim` **ignores** whatever XP/ryo a client sends;
  `report-ai-fight` pays, applies the secondary rewards, and writes the hunt +
  apex receipts from the SEALED `battleKind`/`opponentId` in one atomic save
  mutation. The only client-claimed thing left is "I won" — which is exactly
  what step 4 closes. The new settle sends **no amount at all** (pinned).

  ⚠ **Practice grants NOTHING on either route.** `settleAiFightWin` returns
  early for `battleKind: 'practice'` without reporting, mirroring Arena's
  `isPlainPractice` early return. Without that guard the server path would have
  started paying ryo for bouts that are meant to pay nothing.

  ⚠ **`lib/combat-math` and `lib/world-state` import back from `../App`**, which
  drags a component (and its `.css`) into the module graph and makes anything
  above them unloadable under node's test runner. That is why the host loadout
  lives in its own `lib/ai-fight-loadout.ts` and why the sector-territory hit is
  passed into the settle as an `onSectorRaidDamage` hook instead of imported.
  Keep `lib/ai-fight-{api,request,settle}.ts` free of that back-edge.

  New tests: `lib/ai-fight-request.test.ts` (bus + host source guards),
  `lib/ai-fight-settle.test.ts` (the authority split). All mutation-verified —
  removing the practice guard, firing side effects on a refused report, dropping
  the bus fallback, dropping the hunt credit, and weakening the runId+session
  guard each fail them.

### ✅ Fixed: the Apex kill receipt was never produced

`HunterBoard.faceApex` set `pendingAiProfileId` and nothing else — no
`raidBattleKind`, no `missionBattleActive` — so Arena's win path took the
`isPlainPractice` branch, which returns **before** `report-ai-fight` is called.
That endpoint is the only writer of `apexKillReceiptKey`, so an Apex kill left no
receipt and **the purse could never be claimed at all**.

The Apex IS a hunt, and every other hunt beast is fought as a `raidAi`, so it now
is too — on both routes (`setRaidBattleKind` had to be threaded into HunterBoard;
it had no way to say so). Unlike a tracked hunt it has no trail and nothing about
its encounter is modified client-side, so it is safe to seal.

⚠ **Consequence, stated plainly:** the Apex fight now pays the same hunt-shaped
reward as any other beast (ryo + honor seals + aura dust; Territory Control Scrolls
are reserved for finalized Clan War shinobi PvP wins) where it previously paid
nothing. That is the same reward every regular hunt beast
already pays, and the purse itself is unchanged — still separate, still gated on
`apexWeekClaimed`.

- ~~**4**~~ — **DONE.** `api/missions/_ai-fight-outcome.ts` + `report-ai-fight`.

  **Two authority tracks, chosen by whether the token carries a runId.** The
  local Arena path cannot produce a settled session, so gating on one outright
  would break every fight that still falls back (all of App.tsx's temp-AI
  launches). Session present → the SESSION decides. No runId → today's behaviour,
  until step 5 removes the second track.

  ⚠ **The reward was the SMALL half of step 4.** Amounts were already sealed, so
  the real exposure was that nothing reported a DEFEAT. Found by audit:

  - **A server AI fight cost nothing to lose.** The local Arena writes surviving
    HP back and does `{hp: 0, hospitalized: true}` on defeat. No server-resolved
    mode did either — not combat missions, not story bosses. Routing AI fights
    would have deleted the entire risk side of hunts, guards and ambushes.
  - **`MissionArenaFight.leaveFight` makes no server call at all**, so a player
    about to lose could close the screen and walk away untouched — a free retry,
    every time, strictly better than winning carefully.

  Both close in the same rule: an `active` session settles as a **forfeit** and
  hospitalizes exactly like a defeat; a win carries its surviving HP back, in the
  SAME `mutatePlayerSave` as the payout, so a win can never bank the reward while
  losing the damage it cost. A **missing** session is `unknown` — it neither pays
  nor punishes, because a lapsed store TTL is far likelier than a cheat.

  The client settles on EVERY resolution (`settleOnAnyDone`) and on close
  (`shouldSettleOnClose`). Practice still settles — losing a practice bout costs
  the same hospital stay — but `aiFightPaysReward` keeps it paying nothing,
  matching Arena's `isPlainPractice` early return.

  ⚠ **Both rules are functions, not inline conditions, on purpose.** Inlined in
  the component/handler they could only be grep-asserted, and a grep cannot tell
  a live branch from a dead one — `if (false && …)` passed a source guard that
  looked right. They are unit-tested and mutation-verified instead.
- **5 — NOT a cleanup. It is the migration of five more subsystems.**

  Retiring the local Arena AI-fight path is often written down as "flip the flag
  and delete the fallbacks". It is not, and the reason is one function:

  ```
  api/missions/_ai-fight-encounter.ts  loadAiFightProfile(id)
      → builtinAiProfile(id)                  // the generated catalog
      → else kv 'shared:ai-profiles'          // admin-authored, server-stored
      → else null                             // "play it locally"
  ```

  **Every remaining local fight has an opponent that matches NEITHER source**,
  because the CLIENT invents it at launch time and stashes it in
  `temporaryStoryAi`:

  | Mode | Runtime id | Built from |
  |---|---|---|
  | Dungeon warden | `temp-dungeon-ai-<lvl>-<ts>` | `activeDungeonEvent` + starter jutsu |
  | Academy spar | `temp-academy-spar-<ts>` | a hardcoded Lv-1 dummy |
  | VN chapter battle | `temp-vn-ai-<event>-<ts>` | the authored `CreatorEvent` |
  | Endless wave | `endless-<base>-w<wave>` | `pickScaledEndlessAi` (lib/endless-tower) |
  | Hollow Gate | `buildHollowGatePveEncounter(...)` | run state + augments |
  | Wanderers / quest bosses | `makeBuiltinAi(...)` at runtime | sector + arc state |

  ⚠ **The obvious shortcut is the one thing that must not be done.** Adding a
  "seal this template I'm sending you" parameter would let a client hand the
  server a 1-HP boss — the exact authority this migration exists to remove. Each
  mode's opponent has to be GENERATED server-side from state the server already
  holds. The good news is that most of it is deterministic and already extracted:
  `pickScaledEndlessAi` is pure, the dungeon/VN opponents derive from
  admin-authored events the server can read, and the academy dummy is constant.

  Plus the seventh blocker, which is not an opponent at all:
  **hunt quality must move server-side** (above), or retiring the local path
  deletes the Hunter Guild's tracking payoff.

  **Suggested order** (each is independently shippable and each shrinks the
  fallback surface): academy spar → endless → dungeon warden → VN battles → hunt
  quality → wanderers → Hollow Gate. `serverAiCombatEnabled` and the
  `playLocally` fallbacks can only go once ALL of them land; the abandoned-token
  waste (below) disappears with them.

#### ✅ Step 5, subsystem 1/7 — Academy spar (`ede2f1c5c`, DEPLOYED)

The spar was the cheapest of the six because its opponent is CONSTANT: no run
state, no scaling, no authored content to read.

- **Server owns the dummy.** `api/story/_academy-spar.ts` (constants + template
  + eligibility + binding + validation) and `POST /api/story/spar-start`
  (registered in `server.ts`), built on `buildAuthoritativeSoloEncounter` with
  both difficulty seals in the usual order. The request body carries no
  opponent, level or stats.
- **The settle got an authoritative channel.** `/api/story/settle` with
  `kind: 'academySparring'` + a runId validates a `kind: 'spar'`
  StoryCombatBinding and pays from the completed session; the legacy token
  channel stays for the local fallback. `applyAcademySparSettlement` accepts the
  sealed `academy-spar-dummy` id alongside `temp-academy-spar-<ts>`.
- **Client routes through the EXISTING story bus** (`requestStoryBossFight` +
  `StoryBossFightHost`) with two new theme fields, `kind` and `playLocally`.
  App.tsx 7,734 → 7,727 (the dummy drained to `lib/academy-spar.ts`).

⚠ **`ACADEMY_SPAR_OPPONENT_ID` lives in `_settle.ts`, not the builder.**
`_academy-spar.ts` → `_authoritative-story-combat.ts` → `_settle.ts`, so
declaring it in the builder closes an import cycle.

⚠ **The dummy is NOT `builtin-ai-academy-sparring`** — that is the E-rank drill
AI. The real sheet is hp 50, level 1, stats 11–13, about a hundredth of a
generic level-1 mission enemy. `scripts/academy-spar-parity.test.ts` pins client
against server (mutation-verified). Adding it to `builtinAis` was rejected:
that list feeds `playableAis`, so it would become a selectable opponent.

⚠ **Two writers raced for the player's HP, and the fix belongs on the SERVER.**
`applyAcademySparSettlement` writes a scripted `maxHp - 25` on a win while
`/api/pve/fight-outcome` writes the session's surviving HP — both fire the
moment the fight resolves. `settlementOwnsHpOnWin(session)` (keyed off
`towerId === 'academy-spar'`) now skips the outcome write on a **win only**; a
lost spar still reports. (Since 2026-09-24 that report no longer hospitalizes the
beginner: a spar writes no physical consequence at all — `sessionIsSpar`, see
`docs/MMORPG_BEHAVIOR_PASS_2026-09-24.md` — but it still consumes the token.)
⛔ Do NOT fix this in the client: `pve-outcome-wiring.test.ts` asserts the arena
shell's outcome effect contains no `winner === "squad"`, because that gate is
exactly how a lost fight stops costing anything. That guard caught the first
attempt.

⚠ **Three things the shared host would have silently taken from the tutorial**,
all found by auditing rather than by a failing test:
1. *Coaching.* `SparCoach` (the "Basic Attack → now a jutsu → press Wait" hints)
   lived in `Arena.tsx` only, so the sealed path had none. It now mounts in
   `MissionArenaFight` behind a `coach` prop — and needed a `zIndex` prop,
   because it portals to `document.body` at 9000 while that screen's portal sits
   at 1000000, so it would have rendered *behind* the fight it coaches.
2. *Chapter presentation.* Passing `storyTheme` fires `playStoryChapterSting`
   when the opponent walks on and the story victory sting when it falls. The
   spar passes `storyTheme: undefined` and keeps only the portrait and its own
   result card.
3. *The onboarding modal.* The fight is a body portal, so `screen` never changes
   and the coach modal stayed mounted underneath — carrying a live r3f companion
   canvas with no demand frameloop through the whole tutorial fight.
   `onFightOpenChange` → `storyFightOpen` hides it.

Guards: `scripts/academy-spar-parity.test.ts` (cross-root, behaviour),
`api/story/_academy-spar.test.ts` (eligibility/start-settle agreement, binding
swaps, replay), `shinobij.client/src/lib/academy-spar-wiring.test.ts` (the three
above, as source guards — the rules with logic are behaviour-tested).

**✅ Certified by playthrough** (`aa42320ad`). `scripts/release-certification.mjs`
now registers a player, seals a spar, **fights it to a win** through
`/api/towers/action`, and settles: +20 stat points, +30 ryo, `onboardingStep →
cafeteria`, claim latched, repeat settle pays nothing more. It also proves the
other direction — a start body asking for a level-100 apex opponent is ignored,
an unfinished settle is refused and pays nothing, and a spar past the onboarding
step cannot be started.
⚠ The sealed dummy arrives at **37 HP, not the authored 50** — the shared PvE
band softens it for a level-1 player. Assert `<= 50`, never `=== 50`.

#### ✅ Step 5, subsystem 2/7 — Endless Tower, SERVER HALF (`aa0d19a88`)

⚠ **Endless is the odd mode of the six.** Its ECONOMY has been
server-authoritative for a long time — `api/endless/_run.ts` recomputes the entry
cost, per-wave ryo, milestone drops and cash-out from the wave number alone.
Only the FIGHT was client-owned. Do not re-migrate the economy.

⚠ **The old proof does not prove what it looks like.** The `AiFightToken` whose
`opponentId` ends in `-w<wave>` is minted BEFORE the first blow lands: it attests
a wave-N fight was STARTED, never that it was won. `action:'win'` was the client
saying "I beat wave N, and these are the vitals I finished on".

Three new modules, all landed and INERT (nothing calls `wave-start`, no client
sends `waveRunId`):

- **`api/endless/_wave-opponent.ts`** — generates the wave from the run token,
  the wave counter and the save's level. **Deterministic, not random**: the
  client could use `Math.random()`, the server cannot, because a reconnect or a
  late settle must re-derive the SAME opponent instead of rerolling one.
  ⚠ The server pool (generated catalog) is deliberately NOT the client's pool
  (its roster **plus** admin `creatorAis`). Matching them would mean trusting the
  client's roster. So the cross-root parity test pins the **scaling math only**,
  never the pick — do not "fix" it to compare picks.
- **`api/endless/_wave-session.ts`** — seals it into a Tower session **plus a
  binding**. The split is the point: the session says what happened, the binding
  says which run and which wave it was FOR. Without it a cheap sealed wave 1 is
  redeemable against wave 40, which pays several times more.
- **`api/endless/wave-start.ts`** — registered in `server.ts`. Reads the wave
  from the save's run record; the body carries no opponent, level or stats.

`run.ts` gained a sealed channel on `'win'` where the SESSION decides and the
vitals come off it. The legacy token channel stays until the last local fallback
goes.
⚠ **The sealed win's replay receipt is keyed by the wave run id**, so the replay
lookup tries `body.waveRunId` FIRST. Without that a retry after a lost response
misses its own receipt, falls through, finds the binding spent and 409s — telling
the player the tower could not verify a victory it had already paid for.

`buildAiFightEncounter` took optional `floorId` / `towerId` (defaults unchanged,
so the generic AI-fight path is byte-identical) rather than growing a parallel
builder, so a wave inherits the jutsu-mastery seal, the PvE band and the
companion seal. Endless keeps the `'AI_FIGHT'` band dial on purpose — a wave is a
generic AI fight in every way that matters there.

`scripts/endless-wave-parity.test.ts` additionally pins `endlessScaleFactor`,
which had been duplicated across the build-root boundary for a long time with
nothing holding the copies together.

#### ✅ DONE (not next) — subsystem 2's client half

⛔ **This section is the one that caused the duplicate rebuild described at the
top of this file.** Endless shipped on `codex/solo-pve-cutover` (`b15c97277`),
on a different design: no bus, no host, `EndlessServerFight` +
`screens/EndlessTowerFight.tsx`, `action:'settle'` reporting losses too, and no
local fallback. The call sites below are STALE — both `App.tsx:4431` and
`use-endless-tower-actions.ts:43` have since changed shape.

Kept only as a record of what the plan was before the cutover generalised it.
The line-budget and resume-path warnings still describe real constraints.

- **`shinobij.client/src/App.tsx:4431`** — `useEndlessTowerActions({...})`.
  `prepareOpponent: pickRandomEndlessAi` (App.tsx ~5172) picks + scales locally;
  `enterBattle` / `advanceBattle` set `endlessBattleActive` + `pendingAiProfileId`
  and `navigate("arena")`. These are where a `POST /api/endless/wave-start`
  attempt goes, falling back to today's local path when nothing seals.
- **`shinobij.client/src/lib/use-endless-tower-actions.ts:43`** —
  `handleEndlessWin(currentWave, aiFightToken, vitals)` posts
  `action:'win'`. The sealed path sends `waveRunId` instead and stops sending
  vitals; keep the token arm for local waves.
- **`shinobij.client/src/screens/Arena.tsx:6484`** — the local win path that
  calls `onEndlessWin`. Unchanged for the fallback.
- **Rendering** — the sealed wave needs `MissionArenaFight`. `StoryBossFightHost`
  already hosts two kinds (`boss`, `academySpar`) through the
  `requestStoryBossFight` bus and is mounted once in App; adding a third kind
  costs **zero** App.tsx mount lines, which matters because App.tsx is **exactly
  at its 7,727-line budget**. A new host means finding a drain first.
- ⚠ **The resume path is the extra trap.** `endlessCtxKey` (App.tsx ~5182)
  mirrors the live wave + scaled enemy to localStorage so a refresh rebuilds the
  fight, and the battle-lock boot path (App.tsx ~3286) rehydrates it. A sealed
  wave must resume from its `runId`, not from a client-rebuilt enemy.
- The three spar traps apply verbatim: screen-local UI vanishing on the shared
  shell, chapter theming that does not belong, and the body-portal/`screen`
  mismatch (`onFightOpenChange`).

### ✅ Fixed: the weekly boss could near-one-shot players

The weekly boss builds a Tower session and resolves on the server engine, but
**both halves of its difficulty design were client-only**:

- `weeklyBossGuardedHit` — the 8%-per-hit / 15%-per-turn boss→player ceiling.
  Without it the boss dealt its raw stat sheet, which on a 10k-HP fighter is the
  ~9k near-one-shot the clamp exists to prevent.
- the **guard cycle** (`weeklyBossDamageMultiplier` / `isWeeklyBossOpenRound`) —
  guard-up rounds soak 70%, one open round every 4 doubles the player's damage.
  Missing entirely, so the fight had no texture and players out-damaged the
  intended curve by ~38%.

Both are ported into `api/_pve-difficulty.ts` (constant-for-constant) and sealed
via `pveGuard.kind: 'weeklyBoss'`, which **reuses the whole existing clamp path** —
turn reset, the per-target tally, the pre-shield `damageCap`, the AoE-splash cap.
Only the ceiling formula differs. Shipped ON; `DISABLE_WEEKLY_BOSS_GUARD=1` takes
out **both halves together** (they are a matched pair, like B/C: the clamp alone
softens the boss, the cycle alone makes it swingier).

⚠ The seal happens INSIDE `buildAuthoritativeSoloEncounter`, before the
`startRound` + `runAiUntilHuman` it runs inline — the step-B trap.

⚠ **Two vacuous tests were caught writing this**, both by adding an unguarded
PRECONDITION that fails loudly when the scenario stops exercising the thing.
Asserting "the boss stayed under the ceiling" against a sturdy player passes
whether or not the clamp runs. The precondition also disproved an assumption in
the comments: the boss deals **0** on the first turn or two because it is closing
distance, so a one-turn window proves nothing either.

### ✅ Fixed: combat missions and story bosses cost nothing to lose

Same hole as the AI fights, in the two other modes on this engine. Losing a
C-rank mission or a chapter boss left the player at full HP, un-hospitalized, and
free to walk straight back in — while the defeat card told them to "recover and
try again".

Closed by a **new shared endpoint, `POST /api/pve/fight-outcome`**, rather than by
teaching each reward settle to handle a loss. Those settles (`api/story/settle`,
`queue-combat-claim`, `report-ai-fight`) all refuse a losing run *by design*, so
threading a defeat through them would mean teaching each one to pay nothing while
still writing a save. One endpoint, one rule, reused by every mode: it pays
nothing and only writes what the fight cost (surviving HP, or the hospital stay
on a defeat/forfeit), reusing `applyAiFightOutcomeToCharacter`.

`MissionArenaFight` gained an opt-in `outcomeFn`, fired on ANY resolution **and**
on leaving an unresolved run. Modes that don't pass it are unchanged, so towers,
Spire, clan boss and Anbu — which have their own run economies — are untouched.

⚠ **Two traps specific to this endpoint:**
- Its runId is **client-supplied**, unlike the AI-fight path (whose runId comes
  from a token sealed under the caller's own name). Membership is verified with
  `isPveFightMember` — without it, handing in a stranger's *winning* session
  would write their surviving HP onto your save, i.e. a free heal.
- The write is **not naturally idempotent**: re-applying a defeat pushes
  `hospitalizedUntil` further out, so a refresh on the results screen would make
  a defeat get worse the more you looked at it. A per-run KV receipt gates it,
  and a test pins the hazard so the receipt cannot be dropped as redundant.

  `Arena.tsx:861`'s `battleStarted` token-mint effect is the other half of this:
  it is now the FALLBACK path's minting only. Note the host also mints a token
  it then abandons whenever a fight degrades to local — harmless (the token just
  expires unspent, and the daily counter increments on report, not on start) but
  it does halve the effective `ai-fight-start` rate-limit budget. It disappears
  with step 5.

## ⚠ A LIVE leak this pass closed — check it for every new solo mode

`632b6da19`. **Any finished mission could write your public tower standing.**

`/api/towers/settle` gates on three things: the session exists, you are on its
squad, and it is a completed squad win. All three are true of your own finished
combat mission, story boss, weekly boss, AI fight or Academy spar — every one of
those is a real `TowerSession`, because `buildAuthoritativeSoloEncounter` builds
them on the tower engine and passes `embedFloor: true`, so the session carries a
synthetic floor under a reserved id (9_100+) and `floorForSession` PREFERS it.

No currency leaked (a dynamic floor's `firstClearReward` is `{}`), but
`creditFloorClear` still wrote `battleTowerBestFloor = max(current, floorId)`,
added the clear score to `battleTowerRating`, and pushed a phantom entry into
`battleTowerClearedFloors`. The first two are **public leaderboard fields**
(`api/player/_public-index.ts`), and the first-clear receipt has no TTL, so it
was permanent.

`isCatalogFloorRun` in `api/towers/_tower-store.ts` now gates BOTH the
first-clear and assist channels. Stated positively ("catalog floors only") so a
future mode that invents a floor some other way is refused by default.

⚠ Anbu infiltration was safe only **by accident** — it sets `session.floor` to
9101 without embedding a floor, so the old `!floor` check caught it. That is
also why the 9101 id it shares with `combat-d-errand` never mattered.
**Whenever a new solo mode joins the tower engine, re-check this.**

## Traps found the hard way — do not re-learn these

- **`EnemyTemplate['jutsu']` must declare `target` and `tags`.** The engine reads
  both; the encounter builder spreads jutsu through at runtime, so a narrow type
  silently disarms an AI's entire kit at the type boundary.
- **The PvE clamp must go PRE-shield.** The client caps `enemyDamage` before
  `blocked`, and before Wound/Siphon/Recoil/Lifesteal derive from it. Neither
  `res.opponent.hp` nor `fx.amount` exposes that number — both are post-shield.
  Hence the optional `damageCap` in `combat-core/resolveJutsu.ts`. `undefined`
  takes an explicit identity branch so PvP stays byte-identical.
- **`applyAoeSplash` bypasses `runJutsu`** and needs its own cap, or a
  multi-target enemy blast walks past the per-turn ceiling and the mercy floor.
- **`relevelBuiltinAi` DROPS `hpFloorExempt`** (it omits `makeBuiltinAi`'s 10th
  arg). Reproduced deliberately — see `lib/apex-contract.ts:18-24`.
- **`distributeStatBudget` is `STAT_KEYS`-order dependent** (the rounding-stall
  branch). The server list is asserted identical to the client's.
- **Order: re-level applies the HP floor, THEN the band multiplies.** Same as the
  client (`relevelBuiltinAi` → `Arena.tsx:692`).
- **The easy band does NOT make a player immortal.** The mercy floor prevents
  *sudden* death — a player who started the turn above half HP survives it — and
  lapses once they are worn below half. Do not assert immortality.
- **`api/_ai-profile-catalog.ts` is GENERATED.** After any change to `builtinAis`:
  `node --import tsx scripts/ai-profile-catalog-gen.mjs`. `rules` is not mirrored
  (random UUIDs each import would make the drift test flap).

## Combat-mode load audit (done, 2026-08-02)

Player-side loading is **consistent across every sealed mode** — authoritative
save + `augmentSaveWithForgedDefs` + `loadAdminCombatContent` →
`hydrateCharacterFromSave`, guarded by `api/_fighter-authority.test.ts`. Covers
PvP/MPvP (ranked, spar, bounty), solo PvE (missions, story, weekly, AI fight)
and MPvE (co-op towers, clan boss, Anbu). `towers/join.ts` is a pure read with
no re-seal — correct; a prior tampering hole there is closed.

**Hollow Gate PvE is the one mode not migrated at all** (still client-built).

## Working rules that held

- Gate on the **exit code**, never a quiet log. Pipes mask failures.
- **Check the shell's cwd before trusting a gate.** A `npm run build` left over
  in `shinobij.client/` runs the CLIENT build and never rebuilds
  `dist/server.js`. `certify:release` then boots the STALE `dist/server.js`
  (`release-certification.mjs:96` prefers it and only falls back to `server.ts`
  via tsx when absent), which is how a clean tree produced a phantom 27/28.
- `gh run watch --exit-status` returns 0 on FAILED runs — cross-check
  `gh pr checks` before relying on CI.
- Full local gates before a main push: `npm test`, `npm run build` (chains
  sizecheck — `npm test` misses it), `npm run certify:release`.
- **Re-run every gate after a rebase.**
- Verify, don't infer: a passing count is not proof a specific new test ran —
  grep the log by suite name.
- Mutation-check a new parity test (break the source, confirm it fails, revert).
  Two of my behavioural tests initially passed **vacuously** because the test
  driver skipped the enemy's turn entirely.
- Small, reversible commits; each leaves main releasable.

## Loose ends unrelated to this task

- The live-data scanner (`npm run scan:data`) and its cutovers are moot if the
  pre-launch WIPE happens.
- Capacity: ~500 concurrent comfortably per container, ~700-800 ceiling.
  `npm run soak -- --url=<staging>` before launch.
  `docs/runbooks/launch-capacity.md`.
